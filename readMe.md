Create a widget that allows a user to enter a sentence of 5 or more words. When the user clicks a button the sentence should be analyzed.
The widget:

* should highlight any word that is longer than 4 characters,
* and show how many words are in the sentence.

Select a decent color sceme for your widget from coolors.
